The first weekend of April 2020, we piloted our farm pickup and delivery service to Studio City in Los Angeles, California.

A volunteer loaded their car with produce from [McGrath Family Farms](http://www.mcgrathfamilyfarm.com/), an organic, sustainable farm in Southern California.

The McGrath family has been farming this land for 5 generations.

The boxes were paid for by folks who purchased their own and donated boxes to the first responders of the COVID-19 crisis in North Hollywood.

This weekend, April 11th and 12th, we are doubling our deliveries and expanding to three additional Southern California neighborhoods—Mission Hills, East Hollywood and Silver Lake.
